Something definitely did change, which I reported as an issue to the
Debian package maintainers over 3 months ago (to date, no action has been
taken on the report). For details, see:

That seems to be because there is no consensus on exactly what the bug
actually is, much less what to do with it.  Can people please read the bug
report and state on the list what they think the correct solution is?  Then
we can produce a patch and get a fix into debian.

Hasn't this hurt any other distributions?  Why?

I don't think this is a debian issue, since debian merely
redistributes the GNU diff package.

The `bug' is not a `bug' per se: an exit code has changed under
certain circumstances (diffing binary files), and now the aegis
diff_command is no longer adequate for that situation.  IMHO, the
default aegis diff command needs changing, not the `diff' program.

Aegis uses `diff' to collect the changes to files in a human-readable
form.  Aegis does *not* use diff to check whether the file has changed
at all, it uses a checksum for that purpose.  But *if* the file has
changed (as indicated by the checksum) then the `diff' command is
called to produce a human-readable form of the differences for
inspection.  Now the exit command of that process is checked, and if
it isn't 0 (no diff) or 1 (some diff) it is considered an error.
`diff' 2.8 is now exiting 2 for binary files, so the command `fails'
in the aegis sense.  aegis can't tell whether diff had some other
problem like file-not-found or out-of-memory (also exit status 2).

So the easy solution is:
- add a comment to the aegis standard config files stating to add `-a'
  *if* you're using GNU diffa *and* binary files.  I vaguely remember
  that there is already some comment about GNU diff > 2.7 requiring -a
  in the aegis docs.  diff -a produces huge diff files in case of
  binary inputs which might or might not be a problem.

- The solution better resembling the current situation would be to
  call `cmp' if `diff' reports an error (exit > 1).  Then we would get
  `files A and B differ, char x, line y' which is close enough to the
  `binary files A and B differ' message which diff 2.7 produced.

 diff_command =
  "set +e; diff -c '$original' '$input' > '$output'; if test $? -gt 1 \
  ; then cmp '$original' '$input' > '$output' ; test $? -le 1 \
  ; else ; exit 0 ; fi";
Warning: not tested, the idea being to call `cmp' in case `diff'
reports failure (exit state > 1).

| Hasn't this hurt any other distributions?  Why?

Because they do not check the `diff' exit status?  Because they do not
use `diff' to list the differences?  Because they do not feed binary
files to `diff'?  Hard to tell without knowing which packages actually
_use_ `diff'.

Agreed.  diff changed the meaning of its return codes.  Upstream for diff
thinks everything is now ok, and anything relying on diff'ing binary files
getting a proper return code is buggy. 

The debian diff maintainer has no say in the matter, since he just packages
upstreams source.  Other then going back to an old version of diff and
sticking with it (which is a bad idea for other reasons) there is no good
way to change this.

Something like this should work. I'll try it out tonight, and include it with
my next upload.

How many times does diff get used on binary files?  I use xdelta myself.

Aegis has no `diff_command' per se, but it comes with some example
configurations, which all contain the diff exit status test `test $?
-le 1'.  The aegis end-user needs a configuration file containing a
diff_command, and most of the times s/he will copy it from the
examples and modify it (eg. the `build' command most of the times
needs changing, too).

I don't know whether debian ships the aegis package with a
preinstalled project already containing a `config' file.  *If* it
does, the `diff_command' in there should be changed to be compatible
with the other tools distributed.

Aegis itself contains in it's User Guide, section on `using diff and
merge' the following on `diff_command':

    Binary files will often cause modern versions of GNU Diff to exit
    with an exit status of 2, which is probably reasonable most of the
    time.  If your project contains binary files, you may want to
    treat all files as text files.  Use the GNU Diff -a option in this
    case.

I admit I'm still a little "at sea": is this merely in debian, or in the
aegis source too?
